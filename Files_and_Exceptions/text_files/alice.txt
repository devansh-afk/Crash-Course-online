Lewis Carol's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland follows the titular protagonist through a mesmerizing dreamscape where
she encounters absurd characters in surreal situations.

While Alice and her sister are sitting under a tree, she sees a white rabbit that arouses her curiosity.
She follows it down a hole and soon begins to realize that she has happened upon a world whose rules and possibilities
are far different than her own. For example, she is able to change her size with a potion and cake, and in doing so,
she becomes small enough to swim in a pool of her own tears.

As she navigates wonderland, she comes across many absurd characters, such as the Manic Mad hatter and mysterious
Cheshire Cat. Finally, she arrives in the court of the tyrannical Queen of Hearts, where she is called upon as a
witness. When the queen demands that Alice leave due to a rule barring people "taller than a mile high" from the court,
the absurdity of the situation seems to dawn on Alice. She condemns the Queen for the farcical and ridiculous nature of
 the trial. As tensions escalate, Alice finally wakes from her dream, thinking momentarily that the leaves around her
 are playing cards.
